# @churchapps/content-providers

> **ContentProviderHelper** is a TypeScript library for integrating with third-party content providers like Planning Center, Lessons.church, and more. It provides a unified interface for browsing media libraries, handling OAuth authentication, and retrieving content for playback in church presentation software.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @churchapps/content-providers
```

## Usage

### Browse Available Providers

```typescript
import { getAllProviders, getAvailableProviders } from '@churchapps/content-providers';

// Get all registered providers
const providers = getAllProviders();

// Get info about available providers
const available = getAvailableProviders();
console.log(available); // [{ id: 'planningcenter', name: 'Planning Center', ... }]
```

### Use a Specific Provider

```typescript
import { getProvider } from '@churchapps/content-providers';

const provider = getProvider('planningcenter');

// Browse content
const items = await provider.browse();

// Get presentations/playlist for a service
const plan = await provider.getPresentations(serviceId);
```

### Built-in Providers

- **B1ChurchProvider** - B1.Church plans (merges plan items with lesson venues and external providers)
- **LessonsChurchProvider** - Lessons.church curriculum and add-ons
- **PlanningCenterProvider** - Planning Center Services (browse only)
- **BibleProjectProvider** - Bible Project videos
- **APlayProvider** - A.Play media library
- **SignPresenterProvider** - Sign Presenter playlists
- **DropboxProvider** - Media files from a Dropbox account
- **JesusFilmProvider** - Jesus Film Project (Arclight API)
- **CbnProvider** - CBN Superbook curriculum
- **HighVoltageKidsProvider** - High Voltage Kids curriculum (static catalog)
- **LifeChurchProvider** - Life.Church kids curriculum (static catalog)

### Create a Custom Provider

```typescript
import { BaseProvider, registerProvider } from '@churchapps/content-providers';

class MyProvider extends BaseProvider {
  // Declare id/name/logos/config/requiresAuth/authTypes/capabilities and implement browse().
  // Optionally implement getPlaylist()/getInstructions(); the protected apiRequest() helper
  // performs authenticated JSON fetches against config.apiBase.
}

registerProvider(new MyProvider());
```
